It is designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, outside of doing the statistical analysis itself. Warning: these materials absolutely do not constitute a self-contained “book”, nor do they capture all workshop content. But it is useful to us to organize and share certain excerpts in this format.

From the bookdown book: The second button on the toolbar is the search button. Its keyboard shortcut is F (Find). When the button is clicked, you will see a search box at the top of the sidebar. As you type in the box, the TOC will be filtered to display the sections that match the search keyword. Now you can use the arrow keys Up/Down to highlight the next keyword on the current page. When you click the search button again (or hit F outside the search box), the search keyword will be emptied and the search box will be hidden. For the Up/Down arrow navigation to work, remember to leave the cursor in the search box.
