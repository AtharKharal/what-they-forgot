# Setup an R dev environment

There are two different types of R packages you can install, **binary**
packages and **source** packages. When you install released packages from CRAN
using `install.packages()` you are installing **binary** packages. When you
install development packages using `devtools::install_github()` you are
installing **source** packages.

We recommend the `devtools` package to install source packages from GitHub and
elsewhere, and also to install (and develop) packages you may write yourself.

`devtools` can be installed from CRAN like any other package.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Once a **binary** or **source** package is installed they are identical,
however **source** packages which include C/C++ or Fortran code require
additional tools to install, so there is additional system preparation needed.

## Windows: system prep

On windows the compiler collection needed for installing packages with C/C++ or
Fortran code in them is called `Rtools`.

`Rtools` is **NOT an R package**, so it is not installed with
`install.packages()`. Instead download it from
<http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/> and run the installer.

During the `Rtools` installation you will see a window asking you to “Select
Additional Tasks”.

- Do _not_ select the box for
“Edit the system PATH”, `devtools` and RStudio should put RTools on the PATH
automatically when it is needed.
- Do select the box for "Save version information to registry" (it should be selected by default).

## MacOS: system prep

On macOS you will need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which may
already be installed. You can check if they are by running

```r
devtools::has_devel()
```

If they are not installed you have a few options.

- Minimalist approach (what I do): Install Xcode Command Line Tools.
  In the shell:
  ```shell
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- Install the current release of full [Xcode from the Mac App Store](macappstore://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). WAY more
  stuff than you need but the advantage is App Store convenience.

## Verify system prep

```r
devtools::has_devel()
```

If this function runs without error then congratulations, your R installation
is properly setup!
