# Install a source package

How to isolate and experiment with a single package. The world beyond plain usage of `install.packages()`.

  * Install from source
  * Install from any version
  * Install from GitHub
  * Install to temporary library (some old Jenny notes https://gist.github.com/jennybc/4ffc1607d07ed3b025dc)
  
At least mention ... fork, clone, and work with it directly. A connection to Happy Git.
