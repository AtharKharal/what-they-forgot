The impetus for developing and assembling these materials is a two-day hands-on workshop. It is designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. We focus on building holistic and project-oriented workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis, *outside of doing the statistical analysis itself*.

Warning: these materials absolutely do not constitute a self-contained "book", nor do they capture all workshop content. But it is useful to us to organize and share certain excerpts in this format.

Past and future offerings:

  * rstudio::conf 2018, San Diego, CA
  * [Seattle, WA, 2018 October 4 & 5](https://www.rstudio.com/workshops/what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-about-r/) at [The Westin Seattle](https://goo.gl/maps/3KSpPzZjWR92)

The workshops typically include substantial components that draw on other materials, such as:

  * [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com)
  * Iterating well with the purrr package
    - [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) from Jenny Bryan
    - [Row-oriented workflows in R with the tidyverse](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows#readme), originally an [RStudio webinar](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars)
