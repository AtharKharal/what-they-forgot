# Read the source

Often when you encounter an error and you do not immediately understand why or
what it is saying, the first thing you should try is to search for the error
message. You can search the error directly on google, or search on specific sites like
<https://community.rstudio.com> or <https://stackoverflow.com>.

Another option is to GitHub search to shed light on your problem.

## GitHub search

GitHub allows you to [search](https://github.com/search) code, repositories,
and issues which can often reveal useful insights into problems.

Doing a generic search is often fruitful, but you can often get more pertinent
results with a more targeted approach.

## R code on GitHub

The SVN repository used by the R core team to develop R is mirrored on GitHub by Winston Chang at
<github.com/wch/r-source>. This means that all the code used by your
local R session (including compiled code) is searchable.

```{block type = "rmdinfo"}
[Try the activity](activity/22_read-source-01.R) to search the R source for error messages.
```

In addition all code for CRAN packages is mirrored on GitHub by Gábòr Csardi at
<github.com/cran>, which means all the code for CRAN packages is also
searchable.


```{block type = "rmdinfo"}
[Try the activity](activity/22_read-source-02.R) to search CRAN packages.
```
